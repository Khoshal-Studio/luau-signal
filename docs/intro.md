## Installation

### Studio
To install the module you can head to [Releases Page]() on Github and download the .rbxm file for the module. You can then drag this file from your file explorer into the explorer tab in Roblox Studio.

Alternatively you can build the module yourself by cloning the repository and running the command `rojo build --output signal.rbxl`. This requires the Rojo 7.4 CLI.

### Rojo
You can clone the repository and simply copy the `src` directory and place it into your Rojo project. You should rename the folder from "src" to something more suitable such as "signal".
